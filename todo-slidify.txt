OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
Your presentation pushed to github
A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below
Your presentation must satisfy the following

It must be done in Slidify
It must be 5 pages
It must be on github
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line).

You can also do it manually, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ though remember the slidify publish command takes care of this for you if you'd like.
